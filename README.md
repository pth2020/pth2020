Hello! My name is Paulos Tesfazghi. I am a self-directed and motivated software engineer with mathematics, statistsics and computing background.

**Other skills:** Android App Development

<h2>Education</h2>

* Software Engineering at HyperionDev Bootcamp - Dec'23 - Mar'24

<h2>Projects </h2>

* ***[Finance calculator](https://github.com/pth2020/finalCapstone/blob/master/task_manager.py)*** - A program written in python that calculates the amount of money a customer earns on their investment (simple or compound) 
  with a fixed interest rate at the end of a certain number of years. It also calculates the amount of monthly repayment on a bond (house loan) 
  with a fixed interest rate for the extent of months a user wants to take. 

* ***[Task Manager](https://github.com/pth2020/Bootcamp-Portfolio/blob/main/Capstone%20Project%201/finance_calculators.py)*** - A program written in python that allows an admin to register users and create tasks for users, users able to view all tasks,
  generate reports, display statistics. All data is written to and read from text files.

* ***[GCSE Quiz](https://github.com/pth2020/Own-Projects/blob/main/GCSE%20maths%20quiz/quiz.py)*** - A program written in python that allows a user to take a GCSE maths quiz. A user is provided with options to choose from a list of
  GCSE maths areas (Number, Algebra, Geometry, Ratio and Proportion, and Data & Statistics) and then questions are presented under each sub topic from each area.
  For example, fractions, percentages from Number etc. Questions and answers are stored in dictionary data structures. The program prints out percentage score at the end.
  I am planning to develop this program further using GUI, making it more user freindly.
